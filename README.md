## Description

This is a single page company website for a business called Tea Cozy. It's a project from the Codecademy web development track. I was given a design spec and a handful of image files and have created and styled this webpage from scratch.

Please visit [the design spec](https://github.com/chriskorsak/tea-cozy/blob/master/images/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg) to see the design reference I followed while creating this page.
